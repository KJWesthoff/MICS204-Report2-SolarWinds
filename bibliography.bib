abstract = {Modern day organizations are highly dependent on technology which puts them at great risk for cyberattacks. Ever since the emergence of technology, cyberattacks have become more and more frequent and shape greater threats. This report provides a case study of SolarWinds, who are victims to one of the most recent cyberattacks. This report also discusses a general overview of supply chains and possible ways hackers could attack such systems in addition to the consequences victims are left with. Finally, the report provides a list of recommendations in order to prevent similar attacks in the future. Information was gathered through extensive online research. We have found that hackers who target supply chains, usually look for small loopholes in the system or perhaps even plant ones themselves in order to get into the system and eventually attack all the suppliers in the chain. Therefore, all companies must make sure to have a very strong security system in order to protect private or sensitive data.},
